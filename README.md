I'm an aspiring **Full-Stack Developer** currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at **University of the East - Manila, Philippines**.

Iâ€™m deeply passionate about building web applications and understanding how things work from the visual interface that users interact with, down to the logic and data management behind the scenes. My goal is to become a well-rounded developer capable of creating clean, scalable, and user-friendly applications.

At the moment, I'm focused on learning the **core fundamentals of full-stack development**, starting with foundational technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React**. I'm also exploring how servers, APIs, and databases (like **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL**) work together to power dynamic applications.
